# Problem-Set-4
You may work on this in groups if you want, but each person should submit their own answers.

Find a dataset that is currently in a table that you think could be turned into a multi-table database. This can be any kind of data that interests you.

1) Describe the data. Write a metadata document that describes the source of the data, what the data are, what each column is, etc. See for example, this (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. or this (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.. (4 pts.)

 

2) Normalize the data. Write descriptions (words, drawings, or tables are fine--not code at this point) of the tables you could use to normalize these data. Describe why you chose the normalize the data in this manner. Include the column names, data types for each column, primary and foreign keys you would use. (8pts.)

 

3) Either directly in sqlite or in Python with SQLAlchemy, write the code needed to define the tables above. (6pts.)

 

4) Write the code to load the data into the database. (2pts) Note this is only 2 points! Don't spend a ton of time on this. If it turns into a headache, don't worry about it.

 

Extra Credit: Find another dataset, briefly describe the dataset and columns. Briefly describe the tables you would use and how you would normalize these data. (2pts.)
